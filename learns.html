            <h2>The Coffee-Making Process</h2>
            <p>Our coffee-making process starts with sourcing high-quality beans directly from Filipino farmers. After harvesting, the beans are carefully processed, dried, and roasted to perfection. We take pride in our roasting techniques, which bring out the rich flavors and aromas unique to each variety of coffee.</p>
